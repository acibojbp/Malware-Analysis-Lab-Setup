**Disable Windows Updates**:

- Search for `Services.msc` and open it.
- Locate `Windows Update`, right-click and select `Stop`.
- Right-click again and select `Properties`.
- Under `Startup type`, choose `Disabled.`
- Click `Apply` and `OK.`

**Disable Tamper Protection and Anti-Malware**:

- Open Windows Security and navigate to `Virus & Threat Protection > Manage settings.`

**Using Group Policy (recommended)**:

- Search for `gpedit.msc` and open it.

- Navigate to: `Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Microsoft Defender Antivirus > Real-time Protection`

- Enable `Turn off real-time protection`.

- Restart the computer.

- For permanent Microsoft Defender disablement, navigate to:

`Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Microsoft Defender Antivirus`

- Enable `Turn off Microsoft Defender Antivirus`.

## REMnux Installation

This guide walks you through installing REMnux on your system using the pre-configured virtual appliance for a more straightforward setup.

### Requirements:

- Virtualization software compatible with your system (e.g., VirtualBox)
- Internet connection

### Steps:

**Download REMnux Virtual Appliance:**

- Head over to the REMnux website: https://docs.remnux.org/
- Look for the "Get the Virtual Appliance" section: https://docs.remnux.org/install-distro/get-virtual-appliance.
- Download the .ova file. Save it somewhere you can easily find it.

**Verify Download Integrity (Optional):**

-Downloading the virtual appliance directly from the REMnux website reduces the risk of getting a corrupted file. However, verifying the downloaded file's integrity using hashes is an optional security best practice.
-If you want to perform verification, refer to the REMnux documentation for specific instructions on hash verification methods applicable to your operating system.

**Import the Virtual Appliance into VirtualBox:**

Two ways to do this:

- Open VirtualBox
- Click `File` -> `Import Appliance` and browse to your downloaded `.ova` file.
- OR (if it works on your system) double-click the downloaded `.ova` file. VirtualBox should automatically open it.

**Start the REMnux Virtual Machine:**

- Once the import finishes, you'll see REMnux listed in VirtualBox.
- Click the "Start" button (the green arrow) to boot up REMnux.

**Keep the Distro Up to Date:**

- On first startup, open the terminal.
- Run remnux upgrade followed by remnux update.
- For detailed instructions, refer to: https://docs.remnux.org/install-distro/keep-the-distro-up-to-date.

**Take a Snapshot:**

- Before tackling any malware, take a snapshot of the REMnux virtual machine to ensure you can revert to a clean state if needed.

> Additional Notes:  
> The REMnux documentation provides comprehensive details and configuration options for REMnux: https://docs.remnux.org/  
> Ensure your virtualization software meets REMnux system requirements (x86/amd64 architecture).
